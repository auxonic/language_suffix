Language Suffix Drupal Module
====

Allows Drupal to use language suffixes rather than prefixes like is the default on multilingual sites.

The suffix is the configured prefix for the language (en, eng, fra, etc)

Paths will look like example.com/index-eng

This module was developed to comply with Virtual Museum of Canada rules about path formats.

There are some interactions with ajax and other functions that can cause trouble.
